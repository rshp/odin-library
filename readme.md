# This is TheOdinProject Library task.

In that case, in addition to the existing `Book` class (from previous exersizes), `Library` class was defined, containing:

-   An array of books
-   Book addition and removal operations
-   Book card generation and card events handling
-   Some internal helper methods

*   Book card generation done via innerHTML because - lazyness
*   Library has defined css classes and attaches to an existing HTML element (preferably a `div`)

An effort was put in not to define datasets for book HTML elements to syncronize them with book array content)
